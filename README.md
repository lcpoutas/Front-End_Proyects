# Front-End_Proyects

Welcome to my Front-End Projects repository! This is a collection of projects focused on front-end web development, covering both static and interactive web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Sections

1. **html-css**: This section contains projects that focus on building static web pages using only HTML and CSS. These projects demonstrate responsive design, layout techniques, and styling with CSS.
   
2. **html-css-js**: In this section, you will find projects that incorporate JavaScript to add interactivity to the web pages. These projects demonstrate how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create dynamic and responsive websites.

## How to Use

Each project is located in its respective folder inside the **html-css** or **html-css-js** directories. You can explore the code and run the projects locally in your browser. 

### Running the Projects

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/front-end_Proyects.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the folder of the project you'd like to explore (e.g., `html-css/project1` or `html-css-js/project2`).

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the project.

### Tools and Technologies

- **HTML5**: The standard language for creating web pages.
- **CSS3**: Styling the layout and appearance of the web pages.
- **JavaScript**: Adding dynamic and interactive elements to enhance user experience (for **html-css-js** projects).
